# Hand Movement Control Using Arduino
----
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to control the movement of a robotic hand using an Arduino microcontroller. By utilizing various sensors and actuators, this setup can emulate basic hand movements like grasping, opening, and closing. It can be extended to more complex motions and potentially integrated with glove-based controllers or other input devices.
## Components
- Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Servo Motor
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard (optional for prototyping)
